 MySQL
=======

In this howto we are setting up one MySQL Server using k8s, we will use a deployment and NFS as storage.

Setup a NFS Server for your persistent volumes, howto here: https://github.com/wwwted/Oracle-Cloud/blob/master/nfs.md
If you are using a public cloud provider you can most likely use dynamic storage options for PV and PVC.

In bellow examples I have a NFS Server on IP: 10.0.0.50
This NFS exposes folders:
- /var/nfs/pv099

1) Create PV:
kubectl create -f yamls/01-mysql-pv.yaml

2) Start MySQL using a deplyments (one MySQL Server using NFS PV)
kubectl create -f yamls/01-mysql-deployment.yaml

Cleanup:
kubectl delete -f yamls/01-mysql-deployment.yaml 
kubectl delete -f yamls/01-mysql-pv.yaml
Make sure all is deleted:
kubectl get pv,pv
kubectl get all -o wide

Remember to also empty out the datadir on NFS between tests:
- sudo rm -fr /var/nfs/pv099/*
- ls /var/nfs/pv099/
